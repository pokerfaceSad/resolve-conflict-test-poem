# Forever And ALwaYs

* you are the sun that shines brightly throughout my day.
* you are the gravity that holds me down in every way.
* you are the moon that shimmers throughout my night.
* you are stars that glimmer oh so bright.

* you are the oxygen that keeps me alive.
* you are my heart that beats inside.
* you are the blood that flows through me.
* you are the only guy I can see.
* you have the voice of when a mockingbird sings.
* you are my everything.

* you are my one and only.
* you stop me from being so lonely.
* We plan our future as if we have a clue.
* I never want to lose you.
* I want You to be mY husband, and I want to be Your wife.
* I want to be with You for the rest of mY life.
